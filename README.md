# CAD-Model-manipulation-using-gesture-control

Used Opencv media pipe hand detector in our project, which takes care of the hand detection part.

The recognition of custom gesture is done using an Image classification model which was trained on the dataset generated using hand detection. The model was trained on a  web application called google teachable machines.
